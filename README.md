# CyclicRotation

A zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.

For example, the rotation of array arr = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]. The goal is to rotate array arr k times; that is, each element of arr will be shifted to the right by k indexes.
